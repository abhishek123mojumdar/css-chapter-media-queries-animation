we need MEDIA QUERIES for mobile responsiveness

There are 3 devices that media queries cater to

1. Screen
2. Speech
3. Print device

Most of the times we will use 'all'

@media all and (max-width : 500px) {
body {
color:blue
}
}

the above media query will only run when all the conditions of the media is true i.e
The color of the texts in the body will change to blue when width is less than 500 px

so the color of the text will be blue when the screen size ranges from 0 to 500px

important devices that we should learn about are

1.  desktops and laptops
2.  tablets and ipads
3.  mobile phones
